description:## FastAPI Enterprise Template â€“ Developer Rules

- **Python Version:**
  All code must target Python 3.12 or higher.
  _Enforced in pyproject.toml, Dockerfiles, CI, and all scripts._

- **Dependency Management:**
  Use only Poetry (`pyproject.toml`) for dependencies.
  Do **not** use requirements.txt.
  All libraries and tools must be compatible with Python 3.12+.

- **Core Libraries:**
  Use FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic v2+, SQLAlchemy 2.0+, asyncpg only.

- **Dev Tooling:**
  - Lint/format: Black, Ruff, isort
  - Type checks: mypy
  - Testing: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio
  - Security: Bandit
  - Docs: mkdocs
  - DB Migrations: Alembic
  - Pre-commit required for all contributors

- **Async Everywhere:**
  Use `async/await` for all endpoints, database interactions, and external API calls where possible.

- **Type Hints:**
  All functions and methods must have explicit type annotations (inputs and return types).

- **Testing & Coverage:**
  Every new feature or bugfix requires tests.
  Minimum test coverage: **90%** (pytest + coverage).
  Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests.

- **Documentation:**
  Update mkdocs documentation with every feature or change.
  API documentation auto-generated via FastAPI.

- **Docker:**
  Use `python:3.12-slim` as the base image in all Dockerfiles.

## Documentation Rule

- Any significant code, feature, or process change must be **reflected in both `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md`**.
- Always review and update these files to keep onboarding, usage, and contribution instructions clear and current.

> If you add a new process, tool, or guideline, make sure it's described in both files as appropriate.


- **Contribution:**
  Use provided GitHub issue and PR templates.
  Pre-commit hooks must pass before every commit/PR.
